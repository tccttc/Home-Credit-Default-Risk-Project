# Home Credit Default Risk

Theis project aims to manipulate Machine Learning Algotithm Predict the default probability of the client, based in multiple datasets with the client's credit record.

# Skills
Python with sklearn | Feature Engineering | Data Preprocessing | Exploratory Data Analysis 

# Implementation and Methodology
- **Feature Engineering**: Aggregation, merge and selection of columns based on the feature properties
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handled missing and infinite values and visualized the result
  - Performed one-hot encoding on the train and test datasets
  - Explored the distribution of target labels and discovered the imbalance issue
- **Model building and evaluation**: Built multiple machine learning models, including Logistic regression, Random Forest Classifier, LDA, XGBClassifier and LightGBM, and evaluate their performance in the prediction task

# Performance
- The best model LightGBM achieved 91% accuracy and a 0.76 AUC score.
